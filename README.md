# The Recipe to an Adaptation

Research Study for DH140 at UCLA. 

**Brief Intro**
Quickly scrolling through the list of winners of adaptation Oscar winners on Wikipedia, one will notice that most of these adaptations are based on novels. Very few were theatrical plays, musicals, and especially graphic novels. We ask the question why?The medium lends itself to adaptations as storyboards are already laid out and the script is basically all written. Is it possible the Oscars don't value adaptations based off of other types of work. Or maybe the quality of adaptations that were made based on graphic novels were never good enough to gain that Oscar nomination. Or maybe there is just a lack of graphic novels in the literary space to begin with. Graphic Novels has never been a respected piece of literature. Their lack of text and abundance of pictures, draw comparisons to childrenâ€™s books, creating notions that graphic novels are incapable of revealing deeper meanings and insights to life as novels do. With so many outside factors it's hard to determine why graphic novels aren't more adapted in today's society. But maybe the books themselves can reveal traits or characteristics that may shed some light on what makes a good graphic novel for adaptation.

Data from Graphic Narrative Corpus is used to answer the question:
